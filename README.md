# Extended Dropper

## Features

- Dropper can now emulate left clicking the facing block/entities with tools in its inventory.

## Trivia
- Dropper will never drop tools after installing this mod.
- Dropper still selects its inventory randomly. Thus you can put in many tools to try to mine whatever block placed in front.
- Dropper respects the tool's effective tags settings.
- Dropper respects vanilla enchantments when breaking blocks.
- Can only enter kill mode if the front is clear (no slabs, no pressure plates, no torches etc.).
- Any tool could be used to kill mobs, but durability cost is respected.
- Will not drop experience if used alone.
- Does not respect looting related enchantments, because they require a deeper emulation of player action.
