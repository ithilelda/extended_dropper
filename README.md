# Extended Dropper

## Features

- Dropper can now emulate left clicking the facing block/entities with tools/weapons in its inventory.

## Trivia
- Dropper will never drop tools/weapons after installing this mod.
- Dropper still selects its inventory randomly. Thus you can put in many tools to try to mine/kill whatever is in front.
- If a tool is selected, dropper will try to break a block.
- Dropper respects the tool's effective tags settings.
- Dropper respects vanilla enchantments when breaking blocks.
- If a weapon is selected, dropper will try to kill mobs in front of it.
- Will not drop experience if used alone.
- Does not respect looting related enchantments, because they require a deeper emulation of player action.
